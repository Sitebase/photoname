Script for consistent naming of my photos I take.
This script is part of my photo workflow of which you can read more about in [this blog article](https://www.sitebase.be/my-photo-management-workflow/).

## Using the script
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sitebase/photoname/master/photoname.sh
chmod +x photoname.sh
./photoname.sh dir/myfile.jpg
```

## Comptible platforms
* Tested on Mac OSX
* Tested on Ubuntu

*Unit test are run each time something is pushed to this repository. Tests are run both on latest Mac OSX and Ubuntu.*

## Unit Testing
I've added unit tests to verify change to the script are working as expected. If you find any files producing weird results. Feel free to create a issues and attach your photo so I can do some testing with it.
